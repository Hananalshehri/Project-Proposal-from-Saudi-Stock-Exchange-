 The goal of this project is to better understand which factors are most 
	important in Saudi Stock Exchange over 20 years, and to find how various industries represented
	by stock market indices have reacted to the COVID-19 shock.


To start exploring this goal,
I used a subplots model with two feature to describe the top five height companies whish are:
('SHARQIYAH DEV', 'SADAFCO', 'A.OTHAIM MARKET', 'DUR', 'EXTRA )
, and the  lowest companies:
('SABIC', 'SACO', 'SFICO', 'SIECO', 'SRMG')
